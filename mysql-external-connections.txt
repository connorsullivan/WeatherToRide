Installing and configuring a MySQL server to accept external connections:

1. Install MySQL Server

    "sudo apt install mysql-server"

2. Open the MySQL CLI.

    "sudo mysql"

3. Add a new user that will access the database externally:

    "CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';"

        - '%' is a wildcard. In this case, it allows this account to connect from anywhere, not just locally.

4. Grant permissions to this newly added user.

    "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;"

5. Flush privileges to ensure the changes take effect.

    "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

6. Navigate to /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf and comment out the following line:

    bind-address = 127.0.0.1

        - The bind-address field tells MySQL to only listen to the specified address for connections. 
            By commenting it out, MySQL should now accept connections from any address.

7. Restart MySQL.

    "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart"
