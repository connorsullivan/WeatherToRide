# WeatherToRide

Making travel plans can be challenging, especially when you don't know how the weather will behave. This is an even bigger deal for those riding on motorcycles or other exposed vehicles, as bad weather can make the whole trip a no-go. WeatherToRide is designed with riders in mind, and helps to solve this problem by providing on-demand weather forecasting for the days and times you'll be out in the elements. After registering an account, simply provide your desired days, times, and locations for travel, and we'll do the rest. We'll let you know if you're good to ride, or should maybe take the car instead.

## Getting Started

To get started with your own copy of this application, simply fork or clone this repository.

### Prerequisites & Installations

WeatherToRide is built using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/). Once Python is installed, the remaining dependencies can be added using pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running The Development Server

Once you have the necessary software installed (see above), getting the development server running is very simple.

Open a command prompt and from the root directory, type the following:

```
python run.py
```

The development server should launch and be available at http://localhost:5000/

## Live Deployment

Live deployment should include special considerations, such as moving to a more robust webserver (e.g. Apache), enabling HTTPS (e.g. SSL/TLS certificates), and more. It is recommended to research this before attempting it on your own.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - The web framework
